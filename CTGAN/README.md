This folder is just for the information on how I created the synthethic data using CTGAN.
This two files are not really part of the project, but I wanted to keep them here for reference.
    - train_ctgan.py: This is the code I used to train the CTGAN model on the original dataset.
    - model_trainer.ipynb: Prototype code I did to create train_ctgan.py.
